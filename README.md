Objectives
* Data Exploration: Understand the dataset's structure, characteristics, and potential relationships between variables.
* Data Cleaning: Prepare the dataset for analysis by addressing missing values and removing irrelevant features.
* Visual Analysis: Create visualizations to highlight trends and patterns in demographic and employment data related to income levels.
* Model Development: Build and evaluate a machine learning model to predict income classification based on identified features.

Visualization: Various visualizations are created to illustrate relationships between demographic factors (such as age, education, and occupation) and income levels. This includes count plots, bar charts, and box plots to depict distributions and trends.
Statistical Analysis: Basic statistical analyses are conducted to summarize data characteristics and identify key patterns.
Model Building: After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. A logistic regression model is developed to predict income classification based on the selected features. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

Results and Insights: The project culminates in a discussion of the insights gained from the data analysis and model results, highlighting significant factors that contribute to income classification.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a structured approach to data analysis and machine learning, providing insights into the socio-economic factors influencing income levels. The methods employed can be extended to other datasets and predictive modeling tasks, offering a robust foundation for further exploration in the field of data science.
